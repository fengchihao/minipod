TO DO

Numbers denote importance on a 1..4 scale

[1] "buttons" inputs for rider's remote control
[1] on-screen UI for seek/pause/volume/reset etc

We are going with a tabbed UI: tabs at top are

Songs 
- allow track selection
- current track is highlighted
- changing track switches to 'playing' tab
Playing
- track title&tags, seek buttons, pause
- dancing spectrum analyser or some thit, maybe
Volume
- volume and eq settings
 - volume, bass boost, treble boost sliders
 - +6dB boost on/off
 - sound processing filter is off/min/max 

[1] ("reset" is implemented by calling exec() on ourselves)
[2] browse into subdirectories
[1] scroll up/down when too many tracks for screen
[2] nicer fonts
[1] mount USB sticks when we get dbus messages
 it might be easier to do this with a udev rule that automounts
 then restarts minipod in the new directory
[3] m3u playlists would be nice
[1] WMA playback - mostly done, needs integrating
[1] Implement seek
[1] WAV playback
[2] FLAC playback
[3] Oh, go on them: OGG
[2] EQ/mixer controls
[4] Bluetooth
[1] disable screensaver
