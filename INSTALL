0) making this work on anything signficantly unlike a FriendlyARM
mini2440 is outside scope as far as I (the author) am concerned.

1) You will need a compiler that outputs code for an ARM 920T.
Personally I cross-compile from x86-64 using the emdebian toolchain,
but there's probably nothing other than the value of your time
stopping you from building natively.

2) You will need libraries and header files for libmad, tslib and libao.
If you are cross-compiling you will need them installed where the
cross-compiler can find them.

   $ apt-cross -a armel -i  libmad0-dev libao-dev libts-dev

3) the Makefile is set up to work with VPATH so that you can build
for different targets or different optimization settings without
having to make clean each time.  Do

   $ make -C $profile # where $profile in "host", "arm", "debug

to choose one.  These are actually directories containing Makefiles,
so if you need more profiles, just copy one of the existing ones and 
edit as needed
